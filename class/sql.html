        <p>
          Structured Query Language (SQL) is the set of statements with which
          all programs and users access data in a database. Application programs
          and tools often allow users access to the database without using SQL
          directly, but these applications must support SQL when executing the
          user's request.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="How_SQL_Works">
        <header>How SQL Works</header>
        <p>
          SQL differs from general-purpose programming languages like C and
          BASIC, and is technically a data sublanguage. The strengths of SQL
          provide benefits for all types of users, including application
          programmers, database administrators, managers, and end users. Some
          features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Processing sets of data as groups rather than as individual units
          </li>

          <li>Providing automatic navigation to the data</li>

          <li>
            Using statements that are complex and powerful individually, and
            that therefore stand alone
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          SQL lets you work with data at the logical level. Implementation is
          only necessary for manipulating the data. For example, to retrieve a
          set of rows from a table, you define a condition used to filter the
          rows. In this page, all SQL statements use the optimizer, a part of
          Oracle Database that determines the most efficient means of accessing
          the specified data.
        </p>

        <p>
          SQL unifies a variety of tasks into one consistent language,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Querying data</li>

          <li>Inserting, updating, and deleting rows in a table</li>

          <li>Creating, replacing, altering, and dropping objects</li>

          <li>Controlling access to the database and its objects</li>

          <li>Guaranteeing database consistency and integrity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All major relational database management systems support SQL, so you
          can transfer all skills you have gained with SQL from one database to
          another. In addition, all programs written in SQL are portable. They
          can often be moved from one database to another with very little
          modification.

      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Elements_of_Oracle_SQL">
        <header>Basic Elements of Oracle SQL</header>
        This section contains reference information on the basic elements of
        Oracle SQL. These elements are the simplest building blocks of SQL
        statements:
        <ul>
          <li>Datatypes</li>
          <li>Literals</li>
          <li>Format Models</li>
          <li>Nulls</li>
          <li>Comments</li>
          <li>Database Objects</li>
          <li>Schema Object Guidelines</li>
          <li>Syntax for Schema Objects</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Datatypes">
        <header>Datatypes</header>
        <p>
          A datatype is either scalar or nonscalar. A scalar type contains a
          singular value, whereas a nonscalar type contains a set of values. A
          large object (known as LOB) is a special scalar datatype representing
          a large scalar value of either binary or character data.
        </p>
        <p>Some datatypes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Oracle Built-in Datatypes</li>
          <li>ANSI, DB2, and SQL/DS Datatypes</li>
          <li>User-Defined Types</li>
          <li>Oracle-Supplied Types</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some datatypes may require you to use functions, some with multiple
          arguments, to define the accuracy of data storage. Let's look at the
          base function of the <code>NUMBER</code> datatype:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block"> NUMBER(p,s) </code>
        <p>... where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>p</code> is the precision (the total number of significant
            decimal digits)
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>s</code> is the scale (the number of digits from the decimal
            point to the least significant digit)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here are some examples displaying the storage of the
          <code>NUMBER</code> datatype:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
          // &rarr; User input: 123.45 NUMBER // &larr; Stored as: 123.45 //
          &rarr; User input: 123.45 NUMBER(3) // &larr; Stored as: 124 // &rarr;
          User input: 123.45 NUMBER(6, 2) // &larr; Stored as: 123.45 // &rarr;
          User input: 123.45 NUMBER(6, 1) // &larr; Stored as: 123.5 // &rarr;
          User input: 123.45 NUMBER(6, -2) // &larr; Stored as: 100
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Literals">
        <header>Literals</header>
        <p>
          The terms literal and constant value are synonymous and refer to a
          fixed data value. For example, <code>'JILL'</code>,
          <code>'BLUE ROCK'</code>, and <code>'404'</code> are all character
          literals; <code>1010</code> is a numeric literal. Character literals
          are enclosed in single quotation marks (<code>''</code>) so that
          Oracle can distinguish them from schema object names.
        </p>
        <p>Literal types include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text Literals</li>
          <li>Numeric Literals</li>
          <li>Datetime Literals</li>
          <li>Interval Literals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many SQL statements and functions require you to specify character and
          numeric literal values. You can also specify literals as part of
          expressions and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>Below are several examples of valid literals:</p>
        <code class="code-block">
          // Text Literals 'Goodbye' 'ORACLE.dbs' 'Jessie''s umbrella'
          '19-APR-98' N'nchar literal' // Numeric Literals 17 6.53 +255 -255
          15e-04 // Datetime Literals DATE '1987-12-28' TO_DATE('87-DEC-28
          19:30','YY-MON-DD HH24:MI') // Interval Literal INTERVAL '123-2'
          YEAR(3) TO MONTH
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Format_Models">
        <header>Format Models</header>
        <p>
          A format model is a character literal that describes the format of
          datetime or numeric data stored in a character string. It's important
          to note that this does not change the internal representation of the
          value in the database. Converting a character string into a date or
          number determines how Oracle Database interprets the string.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The datetime format model for the string <code>'19:30:59'</code> is
            <code>'HH24:MI:SS'</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The datetime format model for the string
            <code>'12-Dec-1987'</code> is <code>'DD-Mon-YYYY'</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The number format model for the string <code>'$1,234.56'</code> is
            <code>'$9,999.99'</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Nulls">
        <header>Nulls</header>
        <p>
          If a column in a row has no value, then the column is known to be
          null, or to contain <code>NULL</code>. Use a <code>NULL</code> when
          the actual value is not known or when a value would not be meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          All scalar functions (with a few exceptions) return
          <code>NULL</code> when given a null argument. In SQL, it is possible
          to return a value (using the <code>NVL</code> function) when a null
          occurs. For conditions, a <code>NULL</code> value would act similarly
          to a <code>FALSE</code> value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most aggregate functions ignore nulls. For example, consider a query
          that averages the four values: 2000, <code>NULL</code>,
          <code>NULL</code>, and 3000. This query ignores the nulls and
          calculates the average to be (2000+3000)/2 = 2500.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
        <p>
          Comments can increase your application's readability and usability.
          For instance, including a comment in a statement that describes the
          purpose of the statement within your application can make it easier to
          understand. With the exception of hints, statement execution is
          unaffected by SQL comment lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comment can appear between any keywords, parameters, or punctuation
          marks in a statement. There are two ways to include comments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Begin the comment with a slash and an asterisk (<code>/*</code>).
            Comments inside this text can span multiple lines. End the comment
            with an asterisk and a slash (<code>*/</code>). It is not necessary
            for the opening and terminating characters to be separated from the
            text by a space or a line break.
          </li>
          <li>
            Begin the comment with two hyphens (<code>--</code>). Comments
            inside this text cannot extend to a new line. End the comment with a
            line break.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Be aware that some of the tools used to enter SQL have additional
          restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of an application using both kinds of comments:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
          SELECT last_name, salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0), job_id,
          e.department_id /* Select all employees whose compensation is greater
          than that of Priscilla.*/ FROM employees e, departments d /*The
          DEPARTMENTS table is used to get the department name.*/ WHERE
          e.department_id = d.department_id AND salary + NVL(commission_pct,0) >
          /* Subquery: */ (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0) /* total
          compensation is salary + commission_pct */ FROM employees WHERE
          last_name = 'Priscilla'); SELECT last_name, -- select the name salary
          + NVL(commission_pct, 0), -- total compensation job_id, -- job
          e.department_id -- and department FROM employees e, -- of all
          employees departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND
          salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0) > -- whose compensation -- is greater
          than (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)-- the compensation FROM
          employees WHERE last_name = 'Priscilla'); -- of Priscilla.

      <section class="main-section" id="Database_Objects">
        <header>Database Objects</header>
        <p>
          Oracle Database recognizes objects that are associated with a
          particular schema and objects that are not associated with a
          particular schema. They are known as Schema Objects and Nonschema
          Objects. Names must be provided for most types of database objects
          when you create them.
        </p>
        <section class="sub-section" id="Schema_Objects">
          <header>Schema Objects</header>
          <p>
            A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema
            objects. A schema inherits the name of the database user, where each
            user owns a single schema. Schema objects can be created and
            manipulated with SQL and include the following types of objects:

        <header>Schema Object Guidelines</header>
        <p>
          Some schema objects are made up of parts that you can or must name,
          such as the columns in a table or view, index and table partitions and
          subpartitions, integrity constraints on a table, and objects that are
          stored within a package, including procedures and stored functions.
        </p>
        <section class="sub-section" id="Schema_Object_Naming_Rules">
          <header>Schema Object Naming Rules</header>
          <p>
            Every database object has a name. In a SQL statement, you represent
            the name of an object with either a quoted or a nonquoted
            identifier.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A quoted identifier begins and ends with double quotation marks
              (<code>"</code>). If you name a schema object using a quoted
              identifier, then you must use the double quotation marks whenever
              you refer to that object.
            </li>
            <li>
              A nonquoted identifier is not surrounded by any punctuation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can use either quoted or nonquoted identifiers to name any
            database object. However, database names, global database names, and
            database link names are always case insensitive and are stored as
            uppercase. If you specify such names as quoted identifiers, then the
            quotation marks are silently ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following list of rules applies to both quoted and nonquoted
            identifiers unless otherwise indicated:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Names must be from 1 to 30 bytes long with these exceptions:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Names of databases are limited to 8 bytes.</li>
              <li>Names of database links can be as long as 128 bytes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If an identifier includes multiple parts separated by periods,
              then each attribute can be up to 30 bytes long. Each period
              separator, as well as any surrounding double quotation marks,
              counts as one byte.

              Nonquoted identifiers cannot be Oracle Database reserved words.
              Quoted identifiers can be reserved words, although this is not
              recommended.
            </li>
            <p>
              Names may be further restricted by other product-specific reserved
              words depending on the used Oracle product.
            </p>
            <li>
              Do not reuse names that the Oracle SQL language uses as special
              cases. Although they are not reserved, Oracle uses them internally
              in specific ways. These include datatypes, schema names, function
              names, the dummy system table <code>DUAL</code>, and keywords (the
              uppercase words in SQL statements, such as <code>DIMENSION</code>,
              <code>SEGMENT</code>, <code>ALLOCATE</code>, <code>DISABLE</code>,
              and so forth). These words are not reserved. If you use these
              words as names for objects and object parts, then your SQL
              statements may be more difficult to read and may lead to
              unpredictable results.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is strongly advised to use ASCII characters in database names,
              global database names, and database link names.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nonquoted identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character from
              your database character set, while quoted identifiers can begin
              with any character.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nonquoted identifiers can contain only alphanumeric characters
              from your database character set and the underscore
              (<code>_</code>), dollar sign (<code>$</code>), and pound sign
              (<code>#</code>). Database links can also contain periods
              (<code>.</code>) and "at" signs (<code>@</code>). It is strongly
              advised to not use <code>$</code> and <code>#</code> in nonquoted
              identifiers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within a namespace, no two objects can have the same name. Only
              certain schema and nonschema objects may share the same namespace.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nonquoted identifiers are not case sensitive, as Oracle interprets
              them as uppercase. Only quoted identifiers are case sensitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Columns in the same table or view cannot have the same name;
              however, columns in different tables or views can have the same
              name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Procedures or functions contained in the same package can have the
              same name, but only if their arguments are not of the same number
              and datatypes.

          <header>Schema Object Naming Guidelines</header>
          <p>
            To assist in following proper naming conventions, here are helpful
            guidelines for naming objects and their parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use full, descriptive, pronounceable names (or well-known
              abbreviations).
            </li>
            <li>Use consistent naming rules.</li>
            <li>
              Use the same name to describe the same entity or attribute across
              tables.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is important to balance the objective of keeping names short and
            easy to use with the objective of making names as descriptive as
            possible. When in doubt, choose the more descriptive name, because
            the objects in the database may be used by many people over a period
            of time.

        <p>
          The diagram below illustrates the general syntax for referring to an
          object or a part in SQL:
        </p>
        <img
          class="diagram"
          src="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/img/database_object_or_part.gif"
          alt="A flow chart where a long horizontal line, pointing east and spanning the floor of the diagram, branches off and points to an upper 'schema' bubble, which points to a upper '.' bubble, which points to an 'object' bubble along the horizontal line, which branches off and points to an upper '.' bubble, which points to an upper 'part' bubble, which points to the horizonal line, which branches off and points to an '@' bubble, which points to an upper 'dblink' bubble, which points to the horizontal line."
        />
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code><em>object</em></code> is the name of the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><em>schema</em></code> is the schema containing the object.
            The schema qualifier lets you refer to an object in a schema other
            than your own. You must be granted privileges to refer to objects in
            other schemas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><em>part</em></code> is a part of the object. This identifier
            lets you refer to a part of a schema object, such as a column or a
            partition of a table. Not all types of objects have parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><em>dblink</em></code> applies only when you are using the
            Oracle Database distributed functionality. The dblink qualifier lets
            you refer to an object in a database other than your local database.
            Keep in mind that not all SQL statements allow you to access objects
            on remote databases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can include spaces around the periods separating the components of
          the reference to the object, but it is conventional to omit them.
